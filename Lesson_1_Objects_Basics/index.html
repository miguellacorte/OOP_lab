// So what is going on here? Well, an object is made up of multiple members, 
// each of which has a name (e.g. name and age above), and a value (e.g. ['Bob', 'Smith'] and 32). 
// Each name/value pair must be separated by a comma, and the name and value in each case are separated by a colon. 
// The syntax always follows this pattern:

// const objectName = {
//   member1Name: member1Value,
//   member2Name: member2Value,
//   member3Name: member3Value
// };


const person = {
name: ['bob', 'smith'],
age: '32',
bio: function () {
  console.log(`i'm ${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} and i'm ${this.age} years old`)
}
};

// The value of an object member can be pretty much anything â€” in our person object we've got a number, an array, and two functions. 
// The first two items are data items, and are referred to as the object's PROPERTIES. 
// The last two items are functions that allow the object to do something with that data, and are referred to as the object's METHODS.
console.log('age' in person)
